# TODO - Active Work and Future Ideas

**Master list:** This file contains all todos referenced in architecture and API documentation. **Process:** When a task is completed, add it to **`CHANGELOG.md`**, then remove it from this file and from any completed-task language in API/architecture docs.

## Performance & memory (stack rank)

Mirrors **`documentation/PERFORMANCE.md`** — active investigation items; update both when status changes.

| Rank | Severity | Area | Status | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 1 | Medium | Menubar full rerenders on frequent update paths | Mitigated | Fingerprint + leader-only full render; see `PERFORMANCE.md` §4 |
| 2 | Medium | Timer loops: global DOM queries/rerenders | Mitigated | Cached DOM in `timer-round.js`, `timer-planning.js`, `timer-combat.js`; see `PERFORMANCE.md` §5 |

## Settings & feature gating

Canonical tracking table, load-gate vs on/off notes, and file references: **`documentation/plan-settings.md`**.

| Priority | Item | Status | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| High | **Round timer** — register hooks + `setInterval(1000)` only when the feature is enabled | Not started | Same pattern as combat timer; see `plan-settings.md` #6 and `PERFORMANCE.md` (round timer registration row). Note: `Hooks.once('ready', ...)` fires before settings are registered — gate must use `getSettingSafely` with fallback `true`, placed inside the ready callback only. |
| Medium | **Planning timer** — defer `HookManager` registration until enabled | Not started | `plan-settings.md` #7. The planning timer registers hooks during `init` before settings exist; gating requires deferring hook registration itself, not just the ready-phase state init. Non-trivial — do not attempt without full understanding of init/ready ordering. |
| Medium | **Combat / player stats** — optional dynamic import when tracking off | Not started | `plan-settings.md` #8–9; shrinks cold path |

## CRITICAL BUGS

### Chat Card API (first-class posting + docs)
- **Issue**: Theme helpers exist (`module.api.chatCards` → `scripts/api-chat-cards.js`: `getThemes`, `getThemeClassName`, etc.), but there is no first-class API for **posting** themed chat cards. Every coffee-pub module (Squire, Minstrel, Curator, etc.) has built its own card templating system, each reusing Blacksmith's CSS but independently constructing HTML and calling `ChatMessage.create()` directly. This is the same problem that was solved for windows with `BlacksmithWindowBaseV2` — duplicate templating logic scattered across modules means bugs get fixed in some but not others and styling drifts.
- **Status**: PENDING – not current priority; tackle after bugs/performance
- **Contract decision**: Add `chatCards.post(content, options)` / `chatCards.postAnnouncement(content, options)` helpers that wrap `ChatMessage.create` + canonical Blacksmith card HTML, so modules call one API and get a correctly-structured themed card without knowing the HTML internals. Mirror the window API normalization pattern.
- **Location**: `scripts/api-chat-cards.js`, `scripts/blacksmith.js` (`module.api.chatCards`); consumers to migrate: all coffee-pub-* modules that post chat cards
- **Priority**: High – same class of problem as window normalization; do after current bug/performance pass

### Memory Leak Investigation
- **Issue**: Historical tab runaway (non-heap growth / crash) was tracked; **current builds are not reproducing** the old browser-tab growth pattern.
- **Status**: ACTIVE (fresh baseline) — see `documentation/PERFORMANCE.md` for current stack rank, findings, and plan (lifecycle teardown for observers/timers, journal monitor consolidation, menubar/timer hotspots, legacy cleanup).
- **Next Step**: Execute plan in `documentation/PERFORMANCE.md` § "Plan (Next Review Cycle)"; align with **`documentation/plan-settings.md`** for timer gating (#6–7); re-profile after targeted fixes; downgrade to MONITORING if stable.
- **Location**: `documentation/PERFORMANCE.md` (canonical).

## ENHANCEMENTS

### High Priority

#### Card CSS migration to theme system
- **Issue**: Card-type CSS files (`cards-xp.css`, `cards-skill-check.css`, `cards-stats.css`) still use hardcoded colors; they should use the CSS variable theme system for consistency and themeability.
- **Status**: PENDING – Checklist and strategy documented
- **Location**: `documentation/architecture-chatcards.md` → "Migration (internal)" → "Card CSS migration checklist (detailed)"; `styles/cards-xp.css`, `styles/cards-skill-check.css`, `styles/cards-stats.css`
- **Need**: Replace hardcoded colors with `var(--blacksmith-card-*)`; add XP/skill-check/stats-specific or semantic variables where needed; define new variables in `cards-common-layout.css` / `cards-common-themes.css`; test all card types with all themes.
- **Priority**: High – Improves theme consistency and maintainability

### Medium Priority

#### Creature-type / subtype token naming
- **Issue**: Token auto-renaming uses a single global random-name table (`tokenNameTable`); names aren't appropriate to a creature's type/subtype (e.g. orcs vs. elves vs. dragons).
- **Status**: PLANNED — design locked; not started. Full design in `documentation/plans/plan-token-naming.md`.
- **Location**: `scripts/manager-canvas.js` (`_onCreateToken` name source), `scripts/settings.js` (token-renaming group), new `resources/naming-taxonomy.json`, new resolver helper (e.g. `scripts/utility-token-naming.js`).
- **Need**: Per-key RollTable dropdowns (14 types + 4 subtypes: elf/dwarf/gnome/goblinoid), alias JSON as source of truth + canonicalization, cascade `subtype → type → global tokenNameTable`, design-system-styled settings block after the existing token-renaming options. Existing single table stays as failover. World tables first; compendium source later.
- **Priority**: Medium

#### Roll system: Query window integration (architecture-rolls Phase 1.3)
- **Issue**: Query window does not use `orchestrateRoll()`; needs to use unified 4-function flow for cross-client sync.
- **Status**: PENDING
- **Location**: `documentation/architecture-rolls.md`, `scripts/window-query.js`
- **Need**: Modify `window-query.js` to use `orchestrateRoll()`; replace direct `SkillCheckDialog` creation; test cross-client sync. Then Phase 2–4 (architecture unification, validation, production readiness) per architecture-rolls.md.

#### Roll system: System selection respect
- **Issue**: `processRoll()` does not respect `diceRollToolSystem`; hardcoded to Blacksmith roll path.
- **Status**: PENDING
- **Location**: `scripts/manager-rolls.js`, `documentation/architecture-rolls.md`
- **Need**: `processRoll()` respects `diceRollToolSystem`; implement Foundry roll path when selected; document in api-rolls when that doc exists.

#### Rolls API as first-class surface
- **Issue**: Rolls may still be exposed via nested `BLACKSMITH` helpers; there is no dedicated `module.api.rolls` namespace and no `documentation/api-rolls.md` yet.
- **Status**: PENDING – Future enhancement
- **Location**: `scripts/blacksmith.js` (module.api assignment); add `documentation/api-rolls.md` when stable
- **Need**: Expose a first-class rolls surface (e.g. `module.api.rolls = { execute: ... }`); document for developers leveraging the roll system.
- **Priority**: Medium – Improves discoverability and consistency with pins/chatCards/stats APIs

#### Unified Flags system (cross-feature)
- **Status**: IN PROGRESS – infrastructure complete; journal pins wired; pins storage migration pending.
- **Architecture doc**: `documentation/architecture/architecture-flags.md`
- **API doc**: `documentation/api/api-flags.md`
- **Completed**:
  - Architecture and API docs written (all design decisions resolved)
  - `scripts/manager-flags.js` (FlagManager), `scripts/api-flags.js` (FlagsAPI), `scripts/widget-flags.js` (FlagWidget)
  - `resources/flag-taxonomy.json` — unified taxonomy for all coffee-pub contexts
  - 5 settings registered: `flagAssignments`, `flagRegistry`, `flagVisibility`, `flagTaxonomyOverrideJson`, `flagsMigrationComplete`
  - `game.modules.get('coffee-pub-blacksmith').api.flags` live on init
  - One-time migration shim: seeds `flagRegistry` from `pinTagRegistry` on first GM load
  - Journal pins taxonomy/registry lookups redirected to FlagsAPI (`ui-journal-pins.js`, `window-pin-configuration.js`) — **verified working**
  - `_mirrorFlagsForPin()` called at all 5 write sites in `manager-pins.js`
  - `_clearFlagsForPin()` called at both delete sites
- **Remaining (pins storage migration)**:
  1. `manager-pins.js` `deleteTagGlobally` / `renameTagGlobally` — also update `flagAssignments` for pin context
  2. `api-pins.js` tag methods — wrap to delegate to FlagsAPI (keep existing signatures)
  3. After one release: drop `pin.tags[]` from schema; read only from `flagAssignments`
  4. Migrate `pinTagRegistry` world setting → `flagRegistry` (shim already seeds on first run)
- **Priority**: Medium – Core system working; remaining work is pins storage migration

#### Menubar API: Move party tool code out of api-menubar.js
- **Issue**: Party bar registration, party tools (Deployment Pattern, Deploy Party, Vote, Statistics, Experience, Clear Party), party health progressbar, and party-bar refresh logic live in `api-menubar.js`, making that file a mix of API and experience code.
- **Status**: PENDING
- **Location**: `scripts/api-menubar.js` (party tool registration, `_registerPartyTools`, `_refreshPartyBarInfo`, canvasReady hook for party bar), move to a dedicated module (e.g. `scripts/manager-party-bar.js` or similar).
- **Need**: Move all party-specific registration and refresh logic into a manager that uses the public menubar API (`registerMenubarTool`, `registerSecondaryBarItem`, `updateSecondaryBarItemInfo`, etc.). Keep `api-menubar.js` pure API only (registration surface, render, click/context handlers, no built-in party/encounter/combat content). Invoke the party-bar manager from `blacksmith.js` or a central init path after MenuBar is ready.
- **Priority**: Medium – Keeps api-menubar.js pure and aligns with reputation/combat bar pattern (managers own experience, API owns surface).

#### Toolbar Phase 4: Testing & Validation (architecture-toolbarmanager)
- **Issue**: Toolbar Phases 1–3 are done; Phase 4 (testing and validation) remains.
- **Status**: PENDING
- **Location**: `documentation/architecture-toolbarmanager.md`, `scripts/manager-toolbar.js`
- **Need**: Test tool registration/unregistration; verify compatibility with existing modules; **Foundry v13+ only** (per project target); validate API stability.

#### Embedded other-module variables (Squire / panel-notes)
- **Issue**: Blacksmith code embeds constants that belong to other modules (e.g. Squire), creating tight coupling and fragility if those modules change IDs or naming.
- **Status**: PENDING – Investigate
- **Location**: `_Migration/panel-notes.js` (e.g. lines 40–45: `NOTE_PIN_ICON`, `NOTE_PIN_CURSOR_CLASS` / `squire-notes-pin-placement`, `NOTE_PIN_TYPE` / `coffee-pub-squire-sticky-notes`).
- **Need**: Understand why these are hardcoded in Blacksmith; consider moving to Squire, consuming via a Squire/Blacksmith API, or documenting the coupling and any migration path.

#### Pins: Full automated tests and Phase 4–5 (architecture-pins)
- **Issue**: Pins API and rendering are in place; full automated tests and Phase 4–5 (documentation, validation) remain.
- **Status**: PENDING
- **Location**: `documentation/architecture-pins.md`, `scripts/manager-pins.js`, `scripts/pins-renderer.js`
- **Need**: Full automated tests; complete Phase 4–5 documentation and validation items. TODO.md is the master list; remove items when completed and added to CHANGELOG.

#### Hide Dead and Skip Dead Options for Menubar and Combat Tracker
- **Issue**: Need options to hide and skip dead combatants in menubar and combat tracker
- **Status**: PENDING - Needs implementation
- **Location**: `scripts/api-menubar.js`, `scripts/combat-tracker.js`
- **Need**: Settings for `menubarHideDead`, `menubarSkipDead`, `combatTrackerHideDead` with filtering logic

#### Query Tool Review and Improvements
- **Issue**: Query tool needs comprehensive review and fixes for functionality and UX
- **Status**: PENDING - Needs review and implementation
- **Location**: `scripts/window-query.js`
- **Need**: Verify all tabs work, review/fix drop functionality design, fix JSON generation

#### Expand Rulebook Selection Phase 2
- **Issue**: Phase 1 now uses `Number of Rulebooks`, rulebook compendium dropdowns, and `Custom Rulebooks`; phase 2 may still want curated/common-book shortcuts
- **Status**: PENDING
- **Location**: `scripts/settings.js`, `scripts/manager-campaign.js`
- **Need**: Decide whether to add common-rulebook presets/checkboxes on top of the current compendium-driven model

#### Refactor Compendium Settings into Reusable Function
- **Issue**: Compendium settings have repeated code patterns that could be consolidated
- **Status**: PENDING - Needs implementation
- **Location**: `scripts/settings.js`
- **Need**: Create `registerCompendiumSettings(type, displayName, numCompendiums, group)` function to replace repeated loops

#### Combat Stats - Review and Refactor
- **Issue**: Combat stats system needs review and potential refactoring
- **Status**: PENDING - Needs investigation and planning
- **Location**: `scripts/stats-combat.js`, potentially `scripts/stats-player.js`
- **Need**: Review implementation, identify unused code/duplicates, check performance, review UI/UX

### Low Priority

#### Party Stats Export — fragile blob download + no UI entry point
- **Issue**: Two problems. (1) The combat/player stats export uses a hand-rolled blob+anchor download that calls `URL.revokeObjectURL(url)` synchronously right after `anchor.click()`. The click is async, so the object URL can be revoked before the download starts — in Foundry's Electron shell this surfaces as the "Get an app to open this 'blob' link" dialog (same bug that was just fixed in `window-json-import.js`). (2) There appears to be no reachable UI control that actually invokes this export — the handler may be orphaned.
- **Status**: PENDING — investigate reachability, then fix the download
- **Location**: `scripts/window-stats-party.js` (export handler ~lines 478–497, `anchor.download` / `URL.revokeObjectURL`)
- **Need**:
  - Confirm whether/how the export is invokable from the UI; if orphaned, either wire up a button or remove the dead handler.
  - Replace the blob+anchor pattern with `foundry.utils.saveDataToFile(jsonString, 'application/json', filename)` (the canonical v13 helper; sets `dataset.downloadurl` and defers the revoke). Mirrors the fix in `window-json-import.js` `_downloadTextFile`.
- **Priority**: Low — pre-existing; impact limited if the export isn't currently reachable

#### Configure Pin — Section Checkbox Label Size Inheritance Bug
- **Issue**: The "Update All" / "Default" checkbox labels in section headers render too small. `font-size` overrides in `.blacksmith-pin-config-section-check-label` (including absolute `px` values) have no visible effect, suggesting the label text is controlled by an ancestor rule or Foundry's CSS reset that overrides the element styles.
- **Status**: PENDING — `font-size: 11px`, `text-transform: none`, and `line-height: 1.4` are set on the label but not applying. Needs investigation into Foundry's CSS cascade for Application V2 windows.
- **Location**: `styles/window-pin-config.css` (`.blacksmith-pin-config-section-check-label`), `templates/window-pin-config.hbs`

#### Pins: Selection state + keyboard actions
- **Issue**: No concept of a "selected" pin — clicking fires the click event but nothing persists. Desired: click selects a pin (visual ring), selection clears on click-elsewhere or Escape, keyboard actions operate on the selected pin (Delete key → delete with permission check).
- **Status**: PENDING — design validated; no performance concern (pins are a pure DOM overlay, so a single `pointerdown` delegated listener on `#blacksmith-pins-overlay` + a `document` `keydown` handler is sufficient)
- **Location**: `scripts/pins-renderer.js` (selection state, CSS class, deselect-on-outside-click), `scripts/manager-pins.js` (keyboard delete), `scripts/api-pins.js` (expose `getSelectedPin()`, `selectPin()`, `deselectPin()`)
- **Need**:
  - Track selected pin ID in renderer (`PinDOMElement._selectedPinId`)
  - Apply `is-selected` CSS class to selected pin element; define ring/outline style in `styles/pins.css`
  - `pointerdown` on `#blacksmith-pins-overlay`: if target is a pin element, select it; if target is the container itself, deselect
  - `document` `keydown`: Delete/Backspace → delete selected pin (respecting permissions); Escape → deselect
  - Expose `pins.getSelectedPin()`, `pins.selectPin(pinId)`, `pins.deselectPin()` on the public API
  - Fire `blacksmith.pins.selected` / `blacksmith.pins.deselected` hooks so other modules can react
  - First keyboard action milestone: Delete key deletes the selected pin
- **Priority**: Low — good UX foundation for future keyboard-driven pin management

#### Migrate Combat Hooks to lib-wrapper
- **Issue**: Using Foundry hooks for Combat methods that should be wrapped with lib-wrapper instead
- **Status**: PENDING - Needs implementation
- **Location**: `scripts/stats-combat.js`, `scripts/combat-tracker.js`, `scripts/timer-combat.js`, `scripts/manager-libwrapper.js`
- **Need**: Replace `combatStart`, `updateCombat`, `endCombat`, `deleteCombat` hooks with lib-wrapper wrappers for Combat prototype methods


## TECHNICAL DEBT

### jQuery Detection Pattern is Technical Debt
- **Status**: TECHNICAL DEBT – cleanup target now that **v13+ is the supported platform**
- **Priority**: MEDIUM – Reduce over time as call sites are proven native-DOM-only
- **Location**: Multiple files using jQuery detection pattern

In FoundryVTT v13, jQuery is removed from the core UI stack. `html` parameters should be native DOM elements. The jQuery detection pattern is defensive for legacy callers; prefer fixing at the source.

**Action Item:** Audit all jQuery detection patterns and remove those where the source is guaranteed to be native DOM (e.g., `querySelector()` results).

**Migration Task:**
- [ ] Identify which detections are unnecessary (source is guaranteed native DOM) - **IN PROGRESS** - Testing required
- [ ] Remove unnecessary jQuery detection code - **PENDING** - Awaiting test results
- [ ] Create test cases to verify native DOM is always passed - **PENDING** - See audit report testing plan

**Audit Status:** Initial audit complete. Found 74 instances across 5 categories. Key finding: Inconsistency in `activateListeners(html)` and `this.element` handling suggests some detections may be unnecessary. See `documentation/jquery-detection-audit.md` for full report.

### Socketmanager Becoming Monolithic
- **Issue**: Socketmanager is evolving into a "god class" that both manages hooks AND contains business logic
- **Status**: PENDING - Needs refactoring
- **Proposed Solution**: Socketmanager should ONLY manage socket registration/cleanup (like hookmanager), business logic should be moved elsewhere


## DEFERRED

## BACKLOG

### Targeted By
- Add some way to see who is targeting things

### Token Outfits
- Allow for token outfits - extend token/artwork workflows (historically tied to image replacement; **revisit if/when** a supported image pipeline exists in core or a companion module)

### Rest and Recovery
- Allow for long and short rests with configurable food/water consumption and spell slot recovery

### Auto-Roll Injury Based on Rules
- Automatically trigger injury rolls based on configurable rules/conditions (HP thresholds, critical hits, massive damage, etc.)

### Multiple Image Directories for Token Image Replacement
- Allow users to configure multiple image directories with priority order (deferred until a dedicated image pipeline is back in scope for Blacksmith or a companion module)

### No Initiative Mode
- Alternative combat mode where GM manually controls turn order instead of initiative rolls

### Export Compendium as HTML
- Export compendium contents as formatted HTML document for sharing, printing, or archiving

### CODEX-AI Integration
- Integrate CODEX system with AI API for cost-efficient context management, replace conversation history with relevant CODEX entries (likely **outside core Blacksmith** – e.g. Regent or a dedicated AI module; clarify product ownership before implementation)
