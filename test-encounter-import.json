  "contextintro": "As you make your way through the ancient ruins of Darkwood Grove, the sound of rustling leaves and distant whispers fills the air. The crumbling stone walls provide perfect cover for an ambush...",
  "cardtitle": "Goblin Ambush",
  "carddescriptionprimary": "Three goblins leap from their hiding places among the ruins, their weapons gleaming in the dappled sunlight. The largest of them, clearly a warrior, brandishes a rusty scimitar while the smallest, a scout, nocks an arrow to his shortbow. The third, wearing tattered robes and clutching a staff, appears to be some kind of shaman.",

  "contextadditionalnarration": "The ruins echo with the sounds of battle as steel clashes against steel. The goblins' high-pitched war cries mix with the rustling of leaves and the distant calls of forest birds.",
  "contextatmosphere": "The air is thick with the scent of moss and decay. Sunlight filters through the canopy above, creating shifting patterns of light and shadow that make it difficult to spot movement. The ancient stonework is covered in ivy and lichen, providing numerous hiding spots.",
  "contextgmnotes": "The goblins will attempt to flank the party and use their numbers to their advantage. If reduced to half health, the shaman will attempt to flee and call for reinforcements. The ruins contain several hidden passages that the goblins know about but the party doesn't."
