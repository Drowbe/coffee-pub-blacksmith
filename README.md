A comprehensive combat enhancement module for FoundryVTT that provides detailed combat statistics, performance tracking, timing tools, and injury mechanics to enrich your tabletop experience.

The Blacksmith Module serves as the foundational framework for the entire Coffee Pub module series, providing essential services and shared functionality that all other modules depend upon. While powerful as a standalone module with features like enhanced combat statistics, customizable UI elements, and comprehensive token management, its true potential is realized when integrated with the complete Coffee Pub suite, where it orchestrates seamless communication and synchronization between all modules.
