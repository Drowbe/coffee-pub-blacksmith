# Coffee Pub Blacksmith - ROADMAP

<!--
USAGE:
1. To add new items: Add them here in the appropriate section using the format:
   - Your new task title [Priority: P0-P4] [Label: blacksmith, label1, label2]
   They will be automatically created as GitHub Issues.

2. To modify existing items: Edit them in GitHub Issues instead of here.
   This file will be automatically updated to reflect those changes.
